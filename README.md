<h1>MySQL script and database connector in a Python script with classes and a menu that creates or logins employees which can add , like and comment notes. Made for an University subject in 2022.</h1>

<h2>Use: One way of run this is basically have Xampp, Start MySQL locally in your pc, then run the .sql script one by one command in a MySQL ide/administrator like Dbeaver (the one i've used) or
maybe HeidiSQL. Finally open these files in VSC and install mysql-connector-python in console or use pycharm, create a new project and create this two files, copy the code into them and before running them install 
in your Pycharm python interpreter mysql-connector-python. Then run the program and it's done! :D </h2>
